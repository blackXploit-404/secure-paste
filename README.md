# 🚀 Launching: SecurePaste – Encrypted, Self-Destructing Paste Tool
🔐 SecurePaste is a minimal, privacy-first platform to securely share sensitive information — encrypted end-to-end, view-once, and automatically expiring.

🧠 Built for developers, security teams, bug bounty hunters, and anyone who shares secrets online.

✅ What SecurePaste Offers Right Now
🔒 AES-256 End-to-End Encryption
Only the sender and recipient can decrypt the message — not even the server can read it.

⏳ Custom Expiration
Choose when your paste expires:
1 min, 5 min, 1 hour, or 1 day.

🔐 Optional Password Protection
Add an extra layer of security to your paste.

💣 Self-Destruct After View
Once accessed, the paste is deleted forever — no way to retrieve it again.

Bold

Italics
